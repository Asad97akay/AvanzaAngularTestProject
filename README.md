This is the angular client side of the application that generates a GUID for the user each time the user logs in. I created the GUID using browser information such as the mimetypes, useragent, plugin length , screen height width and pixel depth. Using this information created a much robust GUID and the advantage is that each time the user logs in to the website the same GUID is generated and even if the initial GUID is lost some how it is again recovered using this browser information. The application fetches data ( notes) of the user based on the GUID of each user that makes it customized for each user. 
The User Service is created in order to make http calls to the node js apis to fetch and save data based on the user GUID. Add every successful response returned by the node POST api the new note is unshifted to an array in typescript. 
As per requirements i used lazy loading technique to load the notes component asynchronously when the notes route is activated on application start up. For this I generated a my notes module as the lazy module and  pointed my app router to the lazy module.
